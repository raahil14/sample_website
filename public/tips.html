	<h4>Some common myths and problems encountered while building a PC</h4>
	<div class="part">
		<h3>How Much RAM Do You Recommend?</h3>
		<h4>For standard gaming workloads, it's getting to the point where it's hard to recommend less than 16GB of RAM, especially as we've seen memory prices go down.

That being said, if you’re just planning on playing a game, you can probably get by with 8GB. If you’re doing more, like running Discord, or watching a stream while gaming, 16GB is a safer bet.</h4>

		<h3>How Often Should You Upgrade Your System?</h3>
		<h4>The short answer: It varies from person to person.

It really comes down to personal preference and how important it is to each person to have the latest technology integrated into their setup.

For example, if you’re looking to make the upgrade to a higher resolution, there’s a system hardware requirement that comes alongside that transition. If someone frequently wants to transition to the latest monitor tech, they may be more inclined to upgrade than somebody that’s okay with integrating that technology a little bit later.

This is especially true in the case of laptops, where you're looking at both computer hardware improvements, and peripheral enhancements like better displays and keyboards. Generally speaking, the more time that passes between upgrades, the more substantial an increase you'll see in gaming performance.

There are also opportunities for those who are comfortable with DIY to do partial upgrades instead of full system upgrades. That gives people an opportunity to not have to buy a full system at once, but rather upgrade specific components over time.</h4>

		<h3>What Are Some Common Things That People Overlook When Looking for a New PC?</h3>
		<h4>When considering a new PC, you need to make sure your entire setup is balanced.

As we've seen advancements in monitor technology really start to take off, both in terms of resolution and refresh rate, gamers need to be mapping the hardware decisions they make against their setup. If you’re going to buy up on resolution and refresh rate, you need to make sure that your computer is capable of driving that.

Unless your goal for building or buying a system is that eventually you're going to grow into that monitor, then I think the inverse is probably more applicable. If you're going to buy a computer, and you're going to get a really nice system, you need to make sure that you're getting a monitor that's actually capable of pushing that system to that outer edge of its capabilities. If you've spent a lot of money on a system, and you’re using a 1080p 60Hz monitor, you're not taking advantage of the system that you've purchased.
I would also say that for people who are building their first PC, one thing that is sometimes overlooked is the importance of a good power supply. First-time system builders sometimes think that they can save money on the PSU, and allocate more towards seemingly more important components. But it’s important to understand that the power supply is a critical piece of any system.</h4>

		<h3>What Tools Do You Need to Build a PC?</h3>
		<h4>First and foremost, you need a good screwdriver. Something that's magnetic that has a decently long neck is preferable. There are other premium features that you could go for, but I think magnetic is really the big one. That's really it when it comes to building a PC, assuming that you're implementing standard components.

Other things that come to mind: A good workspace. Give yourself a decent amount of desk space — you don't want to build on the floor. Quality lighting is another one. Having something to organize your screws as you disassemble and reassemble your system is also really helpful.</h4>

		<h3>What’s the Ideal Temperature for a CPU During Use?</h3>
		<h4>The ideal temperature is processor specific, and those numbers are outlined in the specification documentation of the processor. This is another one where I checked with our internal cooling experts, and they rightly pointed me to Intel ARK, because there is no one answer. ARK is an easily searchable database that allows you to look up a specific CPU, and see the maximum allowable temperature in the section "TJunction" under "Package Specifications." You don’t want to exceed that number.

If you do, you might start to see thermal throttling, decreased performance, or in extreme situations, system shutdown. You’ll want to make sure that you're targeting lower temperatures.</h4>

		<h3>Myths</h3>
		<h4>“Desktop PCs are dead – it’s all smartphones and tablets these days”
It is true that desktop sales have slowed down in recent years, as portable, handheld devices such as smartphones and tablets have become more powerful. Yet desktops continue to provide a valuable and useful role in both our homes and offices. After all, when it comes to raw computing power, it is hard to beat a desktop.</h4>
<h4>“You shouldn’t mix Nvidia and AMD”
When it comes to building a PC, there is a persistent myth that suggests you should keep your CPUs and video cards within the same family. But there’s really no reason to limit yourself – Nvidia cards are compatible with AMD processors and vice versa. For example, your desired graphics card may be from a different vendor to your motherboard – and that is totally okay.</h4>
<h4>“You need to turn off your computer at night”
This myth continues to be propagated through the net. While in the past, shutting down PCs was a regular part of computing to help lengthen the lifespan of your parts and clear your cache, these days it’s best to let your computer go to sleep when you are done using it. While it is important to turn it off every now and again, it is completely fine to put your computer to sleep overnight.

However, that’s not to say that you should ignore regular (and very crucial) updates that require a quick reboot. Postponing these updates can cause system slowdowns, so we recommend restarting your PC every few weeks to ensure smooth and uninterrupted operation of your Windows-based PC.</h4>
<h4>“Macs are faster”
At Computer Lounge, we have no desire to flame the fans of the perpetual Mac vs. PC war. The argument is resolved simply when you understand that each platform has different strengths. When it comes to gaming, Mac hardware is simply not built for it. While a handful of titles exist on the Mac platform, including Fortnite and Dota 2, the library still pales in comparison to what you can get on your PC. 

At the end of the day, it pays to research both options and understand critically why you would need either a Mac or PC.</h4>
<h4>“More cores equal faster computer performance”
In the world of processors, there is no more widespread myth. More cores always mean more performance, right? With 8 cores common in the market, and 16 cores available with high-end processors, surely you should future proof your rig with a processor with multiple cores?

Not so fast. There are two things to consider. Firstly, consider what frequency your CPU is clocked at. A 6-core processor that is only clocked at 3.0GHz might offer substandard performance gains over a 4-core processor clocked at 4.5GHz. Ultimately, it depends what your application is optimised for; not all applications are well-optimised for multiple cores, and in cases such as these, a CPU that has a high clock frequency may perform better.

It is also important to note that a processor’s advertised boost clock frequency doesn’t necessarily apply to all cores simultaneously. In fact, in most cases when a processor ‘boosts’ as a result of being instructed to complete an intensive task, it is generally only a single core that is clocking up to the task.

If your computing consists mostly of emails, web browsing and light gaming, a 4-core processor with a clock speed of at least 3GHz will be more than suitable.</h4>
<h4>“More RAM equals faster performance”
Adding additional RAM is typically the first port of call when it comes to upgrading our PCs – and for good reason. 4GB used to be the old standard, now 8GB is common and 16GB is the sweet spot for high-end gamers and certain power-users. Yet, some on the internet think it best to jump straight to 32GB, thinking it will maximise their performance and drastically improve their computer speed, but again, it all depends on the tasks you intend your PC to perform. Some situations where we would recommend 32GB and above is 4K video editing, web development and 3D rendering.

Think of it this way – if you don’t exceed your 8GB of RAM with daily use, what use is 16GB, or 32GB? Consider other upgrades – SSDs, for example, can drastically lift performance when it comes to booting your PC up or starting crucial applications. Likewise, your computing experience could be drastically improved if you upgrade your ten-year-old monitor to a modern and high-resolution LCD display. Of course, it is important to upgrade your RAM if you need it, but there are a host of upgrades you should be considering in order to improve your computer experience.</h4>
